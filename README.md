# rock_paper_scissors (JavaScript)

A simple console-based Rock Paper Scissors game built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) JavaScript Foundations curriculum.

## How it works
- The game is played in the browser console.
- You will be prompted to enter your choice: **rock**, **paper**, or **scissors**.
- The computer generates a random choice each round.
- Results are logged to the console after each round.
- The game runs for 5 rounds, and the overall winner is declared at the end.

## Features
- Case-insensitive input (e.g. `ROCK`, `rock`, `rOcK` all work).
- Input validation (invalid entries donâ€™t break the game).
- Score tracking for both the player and the computer.
- Clear console output showing round results and total score.
